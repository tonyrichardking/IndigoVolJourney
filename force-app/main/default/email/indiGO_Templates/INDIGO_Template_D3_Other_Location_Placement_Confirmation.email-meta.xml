    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you so much for confirming your dates and flexibility on location.


Looking at the latest project needs, we are going to introduce you to coordinators of projects we feel might fit with your availability and skills over the next 5-10 days.


What do you need to do now?


Keep an eye out for the email introducing you to projects

Communicate with project directly, to find out all about what they do and what you would be doing on your placement with them

Accept or decline the placement

Confirm to us, if you are taking the placement or not

If not, we will look at other opportunities
