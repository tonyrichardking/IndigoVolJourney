    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you so much for confirming your dates and flexibility.



Looking at the latest project needs, the Help Refugees Hub in western Thessaloniki is where you will be of most value. We will connect you now with the Hub Volunteer Coordinator to find out more.



If you have any questions about what you will be doing, transport, accommodation etc… the HUB volunteer coordinator will be able to help.  Thank you for coming to volunteer! We hope you enjoy your placement.
