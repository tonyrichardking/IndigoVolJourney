    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},



Thanks so much for registering to volunteer. Unfortunately the minimum age to volunteer here is 18 years old or over, so your registration will not be taken any further.



The good news is indiGO Volunteers, is a charity which connects volunteers with volunteer projects all over the world for FREE! We have two projects abroad that will accept volunteers who are 17 or older.



Simply visit our website to find out more - visit indiGO Volunteers



Don’t forget us when you turn 18!



You can stay up-to-date on the refugee by following Help Refugees social channels.

*Note - if you are 18 or over and have received this email by mistake - please complete the form again, making sure you set the ‘Year’ you were born first. We are trying to fix an error in the system. Our apologies - Register Here *
