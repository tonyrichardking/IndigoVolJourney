    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you so much for registering to volunteer through indiGO Volunteers, working in partnership with Help Refugees to coordinate and connect projects that need volunteers, with people like you wanting to help.

Unfortunately due to your availability being less than 14 days, we are unable to place you with projects in Greece, Serbia or Bosnia at this time. However there may be opportunities to volunteer with Help Refugees in Calais, France.


If you would like to find out more about volunteering with Help Refugees in Calais, France - simply reply to this email.
We look forward to your confirmation email,

Peace and Love
